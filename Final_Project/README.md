**⭐︎ How to play?**

: It operates with a mouse click, and when two cards are flipped, it checks if they are paired.
If the two selected cards are paired, mark them as matched, and disable or remove them from the board.
If the two selected cards are not paired, flip back to the back after a while.
Continue to track the status of the matched cards.
Continue the game until all cards are matched.
